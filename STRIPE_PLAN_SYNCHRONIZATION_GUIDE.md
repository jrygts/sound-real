# 🚨 STRIPE PLAN SYNCHRONIZATION - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## **PROBLEM SOLVED** ✅

**Before**: Users experienced delays between subscription changes and access updates because webhooks only updated `stripe_subscription_status` but not `plan_type` and `transformations_limit`.

**After**: Immediate plan updates through:
1. **Enhanced webhooks** that properly update plan details
2. **Real-time verification** in usage API with auto-correction
3. **Manual sync utility** for fixing historical data
4. **Comprehensive error handling** and monitoring

---

## **🎯 IMMEDIATE BENEFITS**

### **For Users:**
- ✅ **Instant access** after subscription upgrade
- ✅ **Immediate restrictions** after cancellation or payment failure
- ✅ **Accurate credit display** always matches Stripe status
- ✅ **No manual intervention** needed for plan changes

### **For Developers:**
- ✅ **Real-time sync** via enhanced webhooks
- ✅ **Auto-healing** system that corrects mismatches
- ✅ **Manual recovery** tools when needed
- ✅ **Comprehensive logging** for debugging

---

## **🔧 WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Enhanced Webhook Handler** (`app/api/webhook/stripe/route.ts`)

**NEW FEATURES:**
- ✅ Updates `plan_type` and `transformations_limit` immediately
- ✅ Handles all subscription events (created, updated, deleted, payment success/failure)
- ✅ Resets usage counters on plan changes
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging
- ✅ Proper plan determination logic

**EVENTS HANDLED:**
- `customer.subscription.created` → Set to Pro plan
- `customer.subscription.updated` → Update plan based on status
- `customer.subscription.deleted` → Revert to Free plan
- `invoice.paid` → Confirm Pro access
- `invoice.payment_failed` → Mark as past_due (but don't revoke immediately)

### **2. Enhanced Usage API** (`app/api/subscription/usage/route.ts`)

**NEW FEATURES:**
- ✅ Real-time Stripe verification when plan mismatches detected
- ✅ Auto-correction of `plan_type` if wrong
- ✅ Fallback to cached data if Stripe API fails
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and logging
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

**VERIFICATION LOGIC:**
```typescript
// The API now checks:
1. Use database function for usage data
2. If plan seems suspicious, verify with Stripe API
3. If mismatch found, auto-correct the database
4. Return corrected usage data
5. Log all corrections for monitoring
```

### **3. Plan Synchronization Script** (`scripts/sync-stripe-plans.ts`)

**CAPABILITIES:**
- ✅ Sync all users with their current Stripe status
- ✅ Dry-run mode to preview changes
- ✅ Single user sync for targeted fixes
- ✅ Comprehensive reporting
- ✅ Rate limiting to avoid API limits

**USAGE:**
```bash
# Sync all users (dry run first)
npm run sync-plans:dry-run

# Apply the changes
npm run sync-plans

# Sync specific user
npm run sync-plans -- --user-id=<uuid>
```

## **🧪 TESTING PROTOCOL**

### **Test 1: New Subscription (Checkout → Active)**

**Steps:**
1. Create new user account
2. Go through Stripe checkout flow
3. Complete payment

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Webhook receives `checkout.session.completed`
- ✅ User immediately gets `plan_type: 'Pro'` and `transformations_limit: -1`
- ✅ Usage API shows unlimited access
- ✅ User can make unlimited transformations immediately

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check webhook logs
tail -f logs/webhook.log | grep "🔗 \[Webhook\]"

# Check user in database
SELECT plan_type, transformations_limit, stripe_subscription_status 
FROM profiles WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

# Test usage API
curl http://localhost:3000/api/subscription/usage
```

### **Test 2: Subscription Cancellation**

**Steps:**
1. User with active Pro subscription
2. Cancel subscription via Stripe dashboard or customer portal
3. Verify immediate restriction

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Webhook receives `customer.subscription.deleted`
- ✅ User immediately gets `plan_type: 'Free'` and `transformations_limit: 5`
- ✅ Usage resets to 0/5 daily
- ✅6th transformation gets blocked

**Verification:**
```bash
# Cancel subscription in Stripe dashboard
# Then check immediate update in database
SELECT plan_type, transformations_limit, transformations_used 
FROM profiles WHERE stripe_customer_id = 'cus_xxx';
```

### **Test 3: Payment Failure → Recovery**

**Steps:**
1. User with active subscription
2. Simulate payment failure (update card to 4000000000000002 in Stripe)
3. Wait for retry
4. Update to valid card
5. Verify access restoration

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Payment failure → status becomes `past_due` but access maintained initially
- ✅ Successful retry → status becomes `active` and access confirmed
- ✅ Multiple failures → eventually `canceled` and access revoked

### **Test 4: Real-time Verification & Auto-correction**

**Steps:**
1. Manually set user `plan_type` to wrong value in database
2. Make API call to `/api/subscription/usage`
3. Verify auto-correction

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ API detects mismatch between database and Stripe
- ✅ Auto-corrects `plan_type` in database
- ✅ Returns corrected usage data
- ✅ Logs the correction for monitoring

**Test Command:**
```sql
-- Manually create mismatch
UPDATE profiles 
SET plan_type = 'Free' 
WHERE stripe_subscription_status = 'active' 
  AND email = 'test@example.com';

-- Then call usage API - should auto-correct
```

### **Test 5: Manual Sync Utility**

**Steps:**
1. Create some plan mismatches in database
2. Run sync utility in dry-run mode
3. Review proposed changes
4. Apply changes

**Commands:**
```bash
# Create test mismatches
npm run sync-plans:dry-run

# Review output, then apply
npm run sync-plans

# Check specific user
npm run sync-plans -- --user-id=<uuid> --dry-run
```

## **📊 MONITORING & TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Key Metrics to Track**

1. **Webhook Success Rate**
   - Monitor webhook endpoint response codes
   - Track `🔗 [Webhook] ✅` vs `🔗 [Webhook] ❌` in logs

2. **Auto-correction Frequency**
   - Monitor `📊 [Usage] ✅ Plan auto-corrected` messages
   - High frequency indicates webhook issues

3. **Plan Mismatch Detection**
   - Track when real-time verification finds mismatches
   - Should be rare after webhook fixes

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Issue**: Webhooks not firing
**Symptoms**: Plan changes don't reflect in database
**Solution**: 
1. Check webhook endpoint URL in Stripe dashboard
2. Verify webhook secret is correct
3. Check webhook logs for failures

#### **Issue**: Database still shows wrong plan after webhook
**Symptoms**: Webhook succeeds but plan_type unchanged
**Solution**:
1. Check webhook logs for specific error
2. Run manual sync: `npm run sync-plans -- --user-id=<uuid>`
3. Verify database permissions

#### **Issue**: User gets wrong access after plan change
**Symptoms**: Pro user sees Free limits or vice versa
**Solution**:
1. API will auto-correct on next usage check
2. Force correction: Call `/api/subscription/usage`
3. Manual fix: Run sync utility

### **Emergency Procedures**

#### **Mass Plan Sync** (if webhooks failed for period)
```bash
# 1. Check what needs fixing
npm run sync-plans:dry-run

# 2. Apply fixes
npm run sync-plans

# 3. Verify critical users
npm run sync-plans -- --user-id=<important-user-id>
```

#### **Single User Emergency Fix**
```sql
-- Get user's current Stripe status first, then:
UPDATE profiles 
SET 
  plan_type = 'Pro',  -- or 'Free' based on Stripe
  transformations_limit = -1,  -- or 5 for Free
  transformations_used = 0,
  last_reset_date = NOW(),
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = '<user-id>';
```

### **Logging & Debugging**

**Webhook Logs Pattern:**
```
🔗 [Webhook] 📨 Processing event: customer.subscription.updated
🔗 [Webhook] 🔄 Updating user plan for customer: cus_xxx
🔗 [Webhook] ➡️ Setting to Pro plan (active subscription)
🔗 [Webhook] ✅ Successfully updated user plan
```

**Usage API Logs Pattern:**
```
📊 [Usage] 🔍 Performing real-time plan verification...
📊 [Usage] 🔄 Plan mismatch detected! Cached: Free, Stripe: Pro
📊 [Usage] ✅ Plan auto-corrected: Free → Pro
```

**Sync Script Logs Pattern:**
```
🚀 Starting Stripe plan synchronization...
🔄 Syncing user: user@example.com
✅ Updated user@example.com: Free → Pro
📊 SYNCHRONIZATION SUMMARY
========================
Total users processed: 10
✅ Successfully synced: 3
⚠️  Unchanged: 6
❌ Errors: 1
```
